This document outlines the plan for developing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a platform to help the HR department manage selection   
processes, replacing their previous Trello usage. The goal is to provide a Kanban-style interface familiar to users while accommodating the
specific needs of tracking talents and their participations across various selection processes.

## MVP Scope                                                                                                                               
Focus on implementing the two-level Kanban structure, basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Processes and Talents, and  
managing Participations within this framework. Implement core navigation and status tracking.

## Kanban Implementation Plan

### 1. **Reusable Kanban Component**
- Build a single-level, Trello-like Kanban component that:
  - Accepts `columns` (e.g., process categories or application steps) and `cards` (e.g., selection processes or participations).
  - Supports drag-and-drop between columns.
  - Allows adding new cards to a column.

### 2. **Page-Based Level Separation**
- **Home Page**:
  - Displays the first-level Kanban (Process Categories → Selection Processes).
  - Each card represents a `Selection Process`.
  - Clicking a card opens a modal with details and a button to navigate to the second page.
  
- **Second Page** (e.g., `/selection-process/:id`):
  - Displays the second-level Kanban (Application Steps → Participations).
  - Each card represents a `Participation`.

### 3. **Modal on First Level**
- When a user clicks a `Selection Process` card, show a modal with:
  - Basic info (title, description, participant count).
  - A "View Details" button to navigate to the second page.

### 4. **Navigation Between Pages**
- Use React Router or similar to handle navigation between:
  - `/` (Home Page) → `/selection-process/:id` (Second Level).

### 5. **Data Flow**
- The first-level Kanban displays `SelectionProcess` data.
- The second-level Kanban fetches and displays `Participation` data for the selected process.
